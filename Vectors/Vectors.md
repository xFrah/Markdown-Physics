> ### Scalar quantity:  
> Quantity involving only magnitude.

> ### Vector:  
> Quantity involving magnitude and direction.  
 The magnitude of a vector is its strength.  
 The length of a vector is its magnitude.

## Adding vectors:  
There are two methods of adding Vectors:  

- >"punta-coda" method:

- > "parallelogramma" method:

  > ![](vectors3.png)

The math behind the operation on vectors follow these two rules:

- Commutative law:

- Distributive law

## Subtracting vectors:  

Subtracting a vector from itself just equals 0 :  
v1 - v1 = 0

A vector with the negative sign is just going in the opposite direction.  
Subtracting a vectors works like adding vectors.

## Components of Vectors:  

> ### The real deal:  
>a = vector  
θ = angle of the components  
ax, ay = x component, y component
>

>
>A better representation of the components:

>![](vectors8.png)  

No explanations needed for this.

### Formula:

> ### Notation:  
> _(ax, ay)_ - Component Notation  
 _(a, θ)_ - Magnitude-Angle notation

### Multiply by a scalar:  
You just multiply the vector.  
2V means that the magnitude has doubled.

## Scalar product:  

Definition taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiV4UQRAUeo):  
The scalar product of two vectors, gives back a scalar value.

> **A × B** = magnitude of A × magnitude of (projection of B on A's direction)

> The projection of B can be calculated using this formula: _B cos θ_

### Properties:  

- It follows commutative law, meaning that we can swap vector a and b and nothing will change.  
![](vectors16.png)  
- It follows distributivity law, meaning that I don't know what it means.
